# Compund-Interest-Calculator
Welcome to my Compund Interest Calculator!

This website is a tool for you to use that helps you calculate compound interest!

I have added a ombre background, title, 4 boxes for you to input information, a calculate button, a section for the results, and a white circle to hold all of the info. I've themed the page pink since it's my favorite color.

Using the code we learned in class and some outside resources I put this website together! I created a grid for the visuals like we learned in class but the code for the math of the calculator I out-sourced to Chat-GPT. I chose a font that was a bit different to the regular Times New Roman... etc, and also found how to add the white circle in the middle and make sure everything in that body fit into it.
